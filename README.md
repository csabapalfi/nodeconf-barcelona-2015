# V8 under the hood - Franziska Hinkelman

## JS engines everywhere

* mozilla - Spidermonkey
* microsoft - Chakra
* apple - JavascriptCore
* oracle - Nashorn (ex-Rhino)
* google - V8

## and they're fast

* see sunspider benchmarks - getting ever faster
* JS not that much slower than optimized c++ code (and faster than unoptimized)

## compilers

* lex -> parse -> translate -> compile
* AOT (ahead of time, e.g C++) vs JIT (just in time, JS)

## V8

* V8 uses two compilers: a quick JIT and optimizing JIT compiler
* hot functions are identified then passed to the optimizing compiler
* optimizing compiler spends a bit more but does more optimizations
* V8 optimizing compilers:
    * 2011 CrankShaft
    * 2015 TurboFan - work in progress
* `d8` - debug V8
* `d8 --trace-opt` - tracing optimizations

## optimizations

* V8 creteas hidden classes to re-use already compiled machine
* `d8 --allow-natives-syntax` - `#HaveSameMap(a,b) === true` if same hidden class
* inline caches - for property access: same hidden class, property at same memory offset
* dead code elimination
* V8 loves constructors and monomorphic functions (same number+type arguments)
* avoid try-catch, for-in, leaking vars, with, eval (seriously?)
* optimize with caution, clearer code first

# Lessons learned from building high traffic web-app  - Patrick Hund
* mobile.de 300 req/sec
* moving away from Java, breaking the monolith
* importance load testing, good monitoring (gatling, grafana)
* the joy of working with node for devs
* lessons learnt:
    * run in prod as early as possible
    * write testable code
    * code reviews are silver pairing is gold (harder but pays off)
    * keep it simple

# IPFS - David Dias

* node is one of the best places of innovation - community, etc

## problems

* web relies on connection to the backbone
* loosing connection, ddos
* location addressing (instead of content addressing)
* irresponsible bandwith usage:  sharing 200MB video - 8 hops, 30 clients, 48GB - ? surely networking stack optimizes something
* we're building more datacenter cables put data closer to user
* internet connection speeds still increasing faster than bndwith requirements but for how long?
* on slow connections inaccesible https sites: TLS handshake timeout
* third world countries
* offline collaboration in the same room?

## goals?

* apps with no origin
* leveraging network cache
* resilient to network partitions/splits
* internet - comes from intergalactic network, right?

## solution

distributed|merkle|permanent web

* merkledag - link of blobs, each blob starts with the hash of the previous one

> Money does grow on trees. It's called bitcoin.

* DHT - holy grail of p2p - discovery of peers, content locations

# Hunting Performance Problems - Daniel Khan

* bad press - usually around perf
    * netflix - node in flames
    * walmart - node memory leak
* so what's node? V8, libuv, std library, bindings ...

## node.js memory model
* resident set size = heap + stack + code
* `process.memoryUsage()`

## garbage collection
* scavenge compact - quick, dirty
* mark sweep - proper one
* `node-gc-profiler`

## heap snapshots
* when you get process out of memory - probably a leak
* simple leak - obvious
* complex leak - closure holding onto whole context, even unused vars
* use `v8-profiler` to take a heap snapshot
* use chrome devtool compare heap snapshot

## node.js vs cpu
* main thread -> event loop -> thread pool
* blocking main thread is not fun
* `v8-profiler`, `startProfiling`, `endProfiling`
* chrome devtool - cpu profiles
* generate flamegraphs

## tips
* set `NODE_ENV`, otherwise defaults to development might cause some modules do weird shit
* build your own dashboard using tools above
* do load testing and measure/profile

# the magic dump - Luca Maraschi

* coredumps - process snapshots
* node has a post-mortems wg and a tracing wg
* check out indutny/llnode, node.js lldb debugger plugin
> bryan cantrill - production is war
* story of a production outage and debugging session:
    * elb trashing machine - terminating instances, hard to debug
    * stack: ec2 running nginx, node
    * taking a dump on linux, move it to smartos - to dtrace and mdb
    * restify + bunyan - implements dtrace probes
    * `prstat` for nice process stats
    * `bunyan -p <PID>` - enable logging w/o restart
    * `joyent/nhttpsnoop`
    * node flag  `--abort-on-uncaught-exception`
    * `pmap -x`, `gcore`
    * `mdb findleaks` - if you're lucky
*   * shown lots of other mdb command
    * in the end it was a typo causing self referencing handler

# middleware evolution - Eugene Pshenichniy

* slides had cool builtin realtim polls
* poll: people love promises
* poll: people love restify
* 'middleware' - series of functions connected together like unix pipes
* implementing 'middlewares':
    * callbacks - hell,
    * generators - not intuitive (poll: what?!)
* co - turn generators into promises
* when implemented with async-await
    * return promise
    * only with babel of course
    * poll people like it

## motivation
* short term: necessity, fun
* grow fond of it, bet on the long run

## attitude

## mentality
* simplicty, YAGNI, no IDEs, no boilerplate, no code generation, etc
* reminds me easy vs simple

## learning
* turbo mode: short feedback loop
* invest in tools but don't overoptimize

## great node skills
* basic js
* network protocols
* T-shaped

## levels

* contributing to open source
* publish your code early
* teach

## pairing

# async microservices with node - Bruno Pedro

organize service around business capabilites
designed for failure
decentralised governance
loosely coupled, limited responsibility

connected through common interface, usually HTTP
synchronous requires more orchestration
have to handle failures, latenc

async calls 1-1: complex

using a broker
AMQP: advanced pub-sub, transactional
publish: fire-and-forget, or confirmed
configurable routing and subscribe
can even consume via webhook (is that in rabbit?)

amqplib

patterns:
work queue, pubsub, webhook, routing, backpressure, RPC (noo)

# networking for node programmers - aria stewart

unix history, beggining of networking, mainframes, terminals
E1 trunk - 50 something 64 KB channels
leased line, wide area network, ATM over DSL

1980s local networks, token ring etc, converged to Ethernet

OSI model, layer 2 ethernet, layer 3 ip

layer 2 -3 link, Ethernet ARP, who has this ip to talk to, then caches
if not local IP to talk to then gateway

layer 3 IP
address for a single interface
4 bytes, network part, host id, A, B, C, D, etc class, /16 /24
/24 network: 5.6.7 host: .1

local not too many routes
on the internet, millions of routeo
broad routes to send traffic to EU, US, etc

starting to use ipv6, 128 bit, 64 bit for host and network, each
routing more complex though

traceroute -an 24.75.24.253
backbone routers don't always incr hop, also don't always advertise

id getting packets accross the network, just by reading a few bytes of the beggining of the paacket

DNS:

layer 4: TCP

connection 2 IPs 2 ports
source port usually chisen randomly
each conn tracks how much bufferspace left to send
drop packets are rarer these dates, but delayed can still happen

TCP starts kind of slow

new constraints: mobile phones
high bandwith but delay
convergence ip6 starting to happen

unevenly distirbuted future, 2G home common

network scale limits, no more ipv4 addresses
ISP doing NAT, same IP fro lots of customers

network disintermediation
hybrid partly p2p - centralized

webrtc - p2p
scuttlebutt, torrent experiment

old mistakes: circuitswitch vs packet
